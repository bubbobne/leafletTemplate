## A Ionic template with leaflet map

I have started this template from [sidemenu template](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-sidemenu). 
This template contain a leaflet map with markers, using merkerclustering.
To build the project I have followed this [post](https://www.airpair.com/ionic-framework/posts/production-ready-apps-with-ionic-framework) by Agustin Haller.

### Required
- Ionic
- Bower
- npm

### Libraries
- [angular leaflet](http://tombatossals.github.io/angular-leaflet-directive/#!/)
- [leaflet markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)

### Use
Start new project:

```git clone https://github.com/bubbobne/leafletTemplate```


Download library and plugin:

```bower install```

```npm install```

Then you can change the markersApi.js by adding your data or endpoint and personalize the layerModal.html to show value in markers.
